# monsters-rolodex:
Just basic React,no hooks. Good begginer app for someone starting out or reviewing the basics. App is connected to an api that lets you search for different monsters.
In the terminal run npm install to install dependencies and then npm start to run app. Displays monsters on cards, that transition on hover, with a gradient background.
